<p>If you are in sales or simply want to read a positive message about spirit, perseverance, and success…I encourage you to read <em>The Greatest Salesman in the World</em> written by OG Mandino. <em>I read this book for the first time 20 years ago and to this day it is one of my Top 5 books</em>. It’s a very quick read and I’ve re-read the book each year of my life using the affirmations to guide my journey.</p>

<p>Over the coming days/weeks I will share a brief summary of each Scroll (aka affirmation).</p>

<p><strong>The Scroll Marked I</strong></p>

<p>“Today I begin a new life. Failure is mankind’s inability to reach his/her goals in life, whatever they may be. <strong><em>Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure.</em></strong> <em>I will form good habits and I will become their slave.</em> Each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success.</p>

<p>I will read each scroll for 30 days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. First, I will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal. Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day’s end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.</p>

<p>Herein lies the hidden secret of all mankind’s accomplishments. <em>As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, for when an act become easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is mankind’s nature to perform it often.</em> <strong>When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Today I begin a new life. And I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will slow my new life’s growth.”</em></strong></p>
