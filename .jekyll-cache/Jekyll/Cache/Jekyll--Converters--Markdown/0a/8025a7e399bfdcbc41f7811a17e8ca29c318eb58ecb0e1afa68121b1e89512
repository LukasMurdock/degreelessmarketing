I"Y<p>I love hearing from people, so please say hello and introduce yourself.</p>

<p>Why? For two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I love getting to know people around the world. (Many of my best friends and even great loves are people who I met when they emailed to introduce themselves.)</li>
  <li>Because I know a lot of people, I can help connect you with someone you should meet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes it’s really me, and I reply to all.</p>

<p>I don’t promote. I don’t invest. And I’m not taking on any new projects. But I love to be aware of what you’re doing, even though I can’t get involved or answer questions about it.</p>

<p>So really the main reason to contact me is to introduce yourself, which I hope you do.</p>
