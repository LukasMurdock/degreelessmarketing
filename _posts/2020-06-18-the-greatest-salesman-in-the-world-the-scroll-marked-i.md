If you are in sales or simply want to read a positive message about spirit, perseverance, and success...I encourage you to read *The Greatest Salesman in the World* written by OG Mandino. *I read this book for the first time 20 years ago and to this day it is one of my Top 5 books*. It's a very quick read and I've re-read the book each year of my life using the affirmations to guide my journey.

Over the coming days/weeks I will share a brief summary of each Scroll (aka affirmation).

**The Scroll Marked I**

"Today I begin a new life. Failure is mankind's inability to reach his/her goals in life, whatever they may be. ***Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure.*** *I will form good habits and I will become their slave.* Each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success.

I will read each scroll for 30 days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. First, I will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal. Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.

Herein lies the hidden secret of all mankind's accomplishments. *As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, for when an act become easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is mankind's nature to perform it often.* **When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will**.

***Today I begin a new life. And I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will slow my new life's growth."***
