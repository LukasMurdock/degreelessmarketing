## How Loyalty Programs Work
Loyalty programs attract and retain customers by rewarding brand loyalty.

Every dollar spent on brand food gives you 2 points and for 125 points you get a free reward. Every dollar spent on brand gas gets you a point and for 100 points you get 10 cents off per gallon.

You can cultivate extreme brand loyalty by blending these rewards into everyday routines. When a customer trusts the consistency of the experience, they will choose to further engage with their selected brand when there are rewards.

## Loyalty Program Examples

### The Mobile App
With over 17 million U.S. members, the Starbucks Rewards Program is one of the most popular loyalty programs in the restaurant industry.

The Starbucks Rewards program delivered through the Starbucks mobile app allows customers to earn points on every purchase.  These points are redeemable for future purchases at any Starbucks location.

The app provides customers the ability to order ahead, pay in-store, and more. It further cements Starbucks in place for every coffee drinker and even sends notifications for promotions and when you’re near a store.

The Starbucks Rewards program undergoes continuous changes to reinvigorate customer satisfaction. The new rewards program in 2019 gave rewards at 25 stars and eliminated point expiration to raise long-term brand loyalty and reduce the churn from disappearing points.

### The Punch Card
The expected and most basic loyalty program is the punch card. Only after a determined amount of purchased product or spent money are rewards given.

With no technical overhead or software to manage, this is utilized by many small businesses due to its simplicity. All that is needed to launch and manage your loyalty program is to design and print out cards. This loyalty program method often doesn’t build as much loyalty due to providing a generally less enjoyable experience. It places the overhead of rewards on customers keeping track of their cards and lacks much of the exclusiveness and personalization required to build a brand.

## Improving the Value of Loyalty Programs
In May of 2020, in the middle of the global pandemic, third-party appraisals had the American Airlines AAdvantage loyalty program valued at $18-$30 billion dollars.

How was the loyalty program worth so much?

Unlike normal expectations of a loyalty program, flying does not generate the majority of airline miles. Instead, *cross-brand partnerships* create the bulk of airline miles.

Points are earned through partner promotions like co-branded credit card spending or buying a partner product. This type of loyalty program protects against downturns because people are still supporting through everyday purchases.

Where Starbucks and airlines make use of loyalty programs, many other retailers use paid memberships. Loyalty programs differ from paid memberships because while they can offer similar rewards, paid memberships require payment before you can fully gain rewards.
