description: Say hello and introduce yourself.
---

I love hearing from people, so please say hello and introduce yourself.

Why? For two reasons:

1. I love getting to know people around the world. (Many of my best friends and even great loves are people who I met when they emailed to introduce themselves.)
2. Because I know a lot of people, I can help connect you with someone you should meet.

Yes it’s really me, and I reply to all.

I don’t promote. I don’t invest. And I’m not taking on any new projects. But I love to be aware of what you’re doing, even though I can’t get involved or answer questions about it.

So really the main reason to contact me is to introduce yourself, which I hope you do.
